Hello!
This is Battle ship game!
The rules are simple, I have a filed with fixed size.
You write some game params(field size, number of ships, game mode).
I generate a filed, if it possible, and than the game starts!
You input the hit coordinates and I will tell did you hit or not
Try to sunk all the ships in the minimum number of moves!
Have fun and enjoy!

How to play:

First run the jar file from Jar directory.
Then follow this tutorial:

First you must input the game settings. The pattern of game settings is:
W H 1 2 3 4 5 EXTRA_MODE_1 EXTRA_MODE_2
What does it means:
W -> game field width.
H -> game field height.
1 -> Carrier count(5 cells).
2 -> Battleship count(4 cells).
3 -> Cruise count(3 cells).
4 -> Destroyer count(2 cells).
5 -> Submarine count(1 cells).
Than, you can activate two game mods: Torpedo mode and Recovery mode.
To activate Torpedo mode, add this after ships count 'T <TORPEDOES_COUNT>'.
For example, to start game with width 5, height 7, carrier count 1, battleship count 0, cruiser count 1,
destroyer count 0, submarine count 1 and enable Torpedo mode with 3 torpedoes, write this:
5 7 1 0 1 0 1 T 3
If you want to activate Recovery mode, just add a 'R' alias after ships count!
For example:
5 7 1 0 1 0 1 R
If you want to activate both Torpedoes and Recovery modes, write this:
5 7 1 0 1 0 1 T 3 R

In any moment you can write this commands:
  * help -> will show the full information about the game and available possibilities
  * exit -> will exit from game
All available commands in a game:
  * help -> will show the full information about the game and available possibilities
  * exit -> will exit from game
  * x y  -> will hit at x and y coordinate
  * x y T -> will launch a torpedo, if this mode is active
About game field:

The field coordinates start at (1, 1) to (WIDTH, HEIGHT)
The left top corner is (1, 1) and right bottom corner is (WIDTH, HEIGHT)
Horizontally this is the x-axis, vertically this is the Y-axis
The field cells aliases:
1. $ -> Means that the hit on this cell was missed.
2. # -> Means that cell is unfired.
3. ? -> Means that the hit on this cell damaged ship.
4. ! -> Means that the ship is sunk in this cell.

For example, field with width 4 and height 5:

    ##$#
    #!##
    #!##
    ##?#
    ####

Now input the game setting by pattern: N M 1 2 3 4 5 M1 6 M2!
Example: 10 10 0 1 2 3 4 T 5 R -> That means:
Field Size: 10x10
Number of ships by type: 0 -> Carrier, 1 -> Battleship and etc.
Enabled torpedo mode with 5 torpedoes.
Enabled recovery mode.
