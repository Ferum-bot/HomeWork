# HomeWork

Hello! My name is Matvey! Now you you can see my repository, where I do some terrible things.
Ha-ha, of course it is a joke. I am sure you like to laugh.

## What you can find:
    * Some cpp code, actually realisation of patterns and some specific classes
    * Kotlin code, which store patterns
